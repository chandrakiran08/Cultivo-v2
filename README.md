# Cultivo v2
An all-in-one agriculture website designed to provide valuable information to farmers in India.   
One of the unique features of Cultivo is its ability to translate the website's content into any regional language in India, making it accessible to a wider audience.   
Additionally, we integrated an AI disease detection system, allowing farmers to detect crop diseases by uploading photos.
